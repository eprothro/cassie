# cassie

This is a work in progress. We're working quite incrementally to provide important features in a lightweight and loosely coupled way.

This library aggregates the following features needed by most applications:

* Database configuration and efficient session management
* Versioned schema migrations
* Query classes

### Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'cassie', '~> 0.1.0.alpha'
```
or
```bash
$ gem install cassie --pre
```
