# cassie

This is a work in progress. We're working quite incrementally to provide important features in a lightweight and loosely coupled way.

The cassie gem combines the following features needed by most applications:

* Database configuration and efficient session management via `cassie-configuration`
* Versioned schema migrations via `cassie-migrations`
* Query classes via `cassie-queries`
