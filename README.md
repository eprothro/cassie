# cassie

This is in alpha stages. We're working quite incrementally to provide important features in a lightweight and loosely coupled way.

Cassie provides support for the components most applications need to work with a Cassandra persistence layer:

* Database configuration and efficient session management
* Versioned schema migrations
* Query classes

### Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'cassie', '~> 1.0.0.alpha'

or
```bash
$ gem install cassie --pre
```
